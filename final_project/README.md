# Face Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

A deep learning project that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is the **Face Mask Dataset** from Kaggle:
- **Source**: [Face Mask Dataset by Omkar Gurav](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset)

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a CNN-based image classification model to identify faces with and without masks. The model is built using **PyTorch** framework to meet course requirements.

## 💡 Inspiration

This project was inspired by the YouTube tutorial by **@Siddhardhan**:
- **Video**: [DL Project 5. Face Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - Deep Learning Projects](https://youtu.be/-6K6-qQrIWc?si=PQxNtDVYMCLfXmRb)

**Note**: The original tutorial used TensorFlow and Keras. This implementation has been rebuilt using PyTorch to align with the course syllabus requirements.
